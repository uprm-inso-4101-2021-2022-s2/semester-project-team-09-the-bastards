Requirement in supermarket system.

Our requirements should have links upwards to the more abstract layout of the higher level goals such as profitability, customer satisfaction, and others, depending on the domain your working on. This of course also depends on the clients you're dealing with.

The following is an example requirement in a supermarket application:

requirement A -> "...the system charges customers the total for all items taken from the supermarket at the cash register except for items previously paid for"

in this snippet of sorts there's a bunch of definitions and concepts that can be expanded. We call these Domain Concepts.

Some of those in the previous snippet are:
- items
- pay
- charge
- cash register

And afterwards is here where the highter level mentioned before comes into play, aka the overall goals for example.


Continuing the supermarket snippet:

requirement B -> "... the system shall provide a scanner for the cashier to scan the items presented at checkout"

This requirement snippet and the previous one are of course related. You may believe that this requirement is in fact a sub-requirement, however, that is not the case, it may not be part of the previous requirement decomposition.

After observing the relatonship between both requirement A and B, we ask ourselves "what kind of relationship is the one A and B has?". This allows relationships to carry more information related to for example, some X goal.

As soon as you  have a requirement, you can turn that requirement into a test evidences wether
